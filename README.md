# aframe-recast

This project uses [Recast Navigation JS](https://github.com/isaac-mason/recast-navigation-js/tree/main) and exposes the ability to bake a navigation mesh in A-Frame.

This component does not handle path-finding using the nav mesh. For that, you can use [aframe-extras - nav-agent](https://github.com/c-frame/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/pathfinding/nav-agent.js)
